### Tasks

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Floor plans ](./0-floor.unity/) | Create a new 3D Unity project called 0x01-unity_concepts. Save your new scene as 0-floor. Create a new Cube GameObject named Floor with the given Transform properties  |
| [1. On the ball ](./1-ball.unity/) | Duplicate 0-floor by selecting the scene in the Project window and either Edit > Duplicate from the Toolbar or CTRL / CMD + D. Rename the scene 1-ball and open it. Create a new Sphere GameObject named Ball with the given Transform properties  |
| [2. Colors! ](./ball.mat/) | Duplicate 1-ball, rename it 2-colors, and open it. Create a Materials folder in the Project window, then create a new material named floor. In the Inspector window, change the Albedo color to any color you like using the color picker. Assign the material to the Floor GameObject. |
| [Gravity is a harsh mistress ](./bounce/) | Duplicate 2-colors, rename it 3-gravity, and open it. Add a Rigidbody Component to the Ball GameObject. Press Play to see what happens. Wouldnâ€™t it be better if the ball bounced when it fell? |
| [4. Prefabricated ](./Ball) | Duplicate 3-gravity, rename it 4-prefab, and open it. Create a new folder named Prefabs. Create a prefab from the Ball inside the new folder, then, using the prefab, add four more instance of the Ball to the scene. Position and scale them any way you like.  |
| [5. Even more colors! ](./ball-*/) | Duplicate 4-prefab, rename it 5-more_colors, and open it. Change the colors of each ball so they are different hex colors as defined below. New materials should be named as listed below.  |
| [6. Tag yourself ](./6-tags.unity/) | Duplicate 5-more_colors, rename it 6-tags, and open it. Add a tag to all Ball objects called Obstacles.  |
